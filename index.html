            <p font-size:12px>Think about you, I keep thinking about you.. 
                For me, there is no flight I would not take, 
                no distance I would not drive and no mile I 
                would not walk just to be with you. On a lighter 
                note, I appreciate all you have done for me, taking 
                the time to see me, cooking for me and devoting yourself 
                to me. You know when people say think of a dog and your 
                mind first thinks about momo? When people say 
                think about love...I think about you. It is so interesting  
                how I am still exploring new emotions at my unc age. 
                I can not believe another year has passed since you were 
                my valentine and this all started because I couldn’t 
                stalk yo page fr!! From strangers to being ghosted to 
                spending our second valentines together.<br>
                Will you be my valentines once again em..?<br><br>
                Happy Valentines Em Yêu
